				<p><a href="http://myaccessible.eu" target="_blank">MyAccessible.EU</a> is part of the European Commission funded CAP4Access project. 
				The project aims at addressing accessibility issues for people with restricted mobility through the use of awareness raising and the 
				development of several tools and methodologies. The Navigation App is one of these tools developed and aims at providing navigation
				instructions that are useful for pedestrians, whilst also allowing the determination of routes that take into account restrictions 
				that are important for people with reduced mobility.

				<h1><span class="right-header">The Navigation App</span></h1>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<p>The Navigation App (downloadable for Android <a href="index.html" target="_blank">here</a>) has been developed at the GIScience 
				Research Group in Universität Heidelberg as part of the CAP4Access project. The advantages that it has over more mainstream navigation 
				apps is that it is linked with the Wheelchair Routing system of the Open Route Service (<a href="http://www.openrouteservice.org" target="_blank">http://www.openrouteservice.org</a>)
				and so the routes used are tailored to people with reduced mobility, as well as providing instructions in a format that is seen as 
				more suitable for pedestrians.</p>

				<h1><span class="left-header">Navigation Instructions</span></h1>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<p>Unlike car based navigation systems that provide instructions in the format <q>In 100m, turn right</q> the Navigation App tries to 
				use landmark based instructions such as <q>After the Covent Garden tube station, turn right</q>. Not only are these instructions more 
				similar to instructions that you would receive from people, they also reduce the need for a judging of distance, which people are 
				often not particularly good at!</p>
				<p>The features selected for use as landmarks are obtained from the <a href="http://openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> 
				dataset. The most suitable instruction is generated using a complex algorithm that takes into account a number of characteristics about 
				the turning point.</p>

				<h1><span class="right-header">User Preferences</span></h1>				
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<img src="img/about/preferences.png" class="screenshot left" /> 
				<p>To ensure that the route used is suitable for people with reduced mobility, the routes are obtained from the Open Route Service at 
				the Universität Heidelberg. Using the wheelchair routing option, steps in the environment are automatically avoided and the user has 
				the ability to set restrictions on incline, kerb height and surface materials. All this information can be entered within the Navigation 
				App.</p>
				
				<p>One of the key features of the app with regards to assisting people with reduced mobility is the generation of routes based on 
				preferences specified by the user. These can be set in the <q>Preferences</q> section of the app. The preferences can also be 
				modified based on a <q>Profile</q> that is selected. The app has a number of pre-defined profiles which represent fictitious people 
				and their routing restrictions. As a user, you can (but do not have to) select the profile that most closely matches your own personal 
				situation, and then tweak the settings to make it fully personalised.</p>

				<h1><span class="left-header">Selecting a Destination</span></h1>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<p>There are a number of methods for selecting the end point or your route. You can either search for a place, drop a pin on a map, select 
				a nearby public toilet, or choose a place from Wheelmap (<a href="http://wheelmap.org" target="_blank">http://wheelmap.org</a>).</p>
				
				<h2>Searching and Pin Drop</h2>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<img src="img/about/search.png" class="screenshot right" /> 
				<p>The most classical method of choosing an end point is through searching or dropping a pin on the map. Both of these options are possible 
				from the main route definition screen. On the map view (after clicking the <q>Select</q> button in the <q>Destination</q> area) pressing 
				and holding the screen will drop a pin at that location. If available, the address will be shown in the search box. Otherwise, you can 
				type in the name and/or address into the search box, and click <q>Search</q> to show matches that have been found in the OpenStreetMap 
				database. Once a pin has been placed through either of these methods, <q>Select</q> can be clicked and the place will be used as your 
				destination.</p>
				
				<h2>Nearby Toilet</h2>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<img src="img/about/toilet.png" class="screenshot left" /> 
				<p>To find a nearby toilet, simply click on the <q>Find nearby public toilets</q> button from the front screen to show a map of your 
				surroundings with toilets highlighted. Green markers <img src="img/about/map_pin_small_green.png" class="app_icon" /> are toilets that have 
				been marked as wheelchair accessible, yellow <img src="img/about/map_pin_small_yellow.png" class="app_icon" /> are ones marked as having 
				limited accessibility (i.e. may have no steps but lack wheelchair specific facilities), red <img src="img/about/map_pin_small.png" class="app_icon" /> 
				have been marked as not wheelchair accessible, and grey <img src="img/about/map_pin_small_grey.png" class="app_icon" /> do not have any 
				information available regarding accessibility. Once clicked, the <q>Select</q> button can be selected to use the toilet as the target 
				destination.</p>
				
				<h2>Wheelmap Destination</h2>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<p><a href="http://wheelmap.org" target="_blank">Wheelmap.org</a> is an online map that allows people to find and mark places as being 
				wheelchair accessible or not. The Navigation App makes use of their data to allow you to select a nearby place that matches your accessibility 
				requirements. After selecting a particular category of place (i.e. Food, Accomodation, Health) you are presented with a list of nearby 
				places ordered by how close they are to you. This list can also be further filtered to restrict results, such as showing only Cafes or 
				Bars. On the list, icons are used to signify the accessibility of the place:</p>
				<img src="img/about/yes.png" class="app_icon" /> - The place is wheelchair accessible,<br/>
				<img src="img/about/partial.png" class="app_icon" /> - The place has limited wheelchair accessibility,<br/>
				<img src="img/about/no.png" class="app_icon" /> - The place has no wheelchair accessibility,<br/>
				<img src="img/about/unknown.png" class="app_icon" /> - The accessibility of the place is unknown.<br/>
				<p>After selecting a place from the list, further information is displayed including its address, website address and telephone number. 
				Clicking the phone number will place a call to them, and clicking the website address will open that site on your devices internet 
				browser. If you want to go to this place, clicking the <q>Take me there</q> will use it as the destination for the route.</p>

				<h1><span class="right-header">For the Techies - Navigation API</span></h1>
				<p class="post-header"></p>
				<p>The navigation instructions used in the app are generated within a web service. This web service is publicly accessible through API 
				calls. The output of the API is in GeoJSON format, with instructions being supplied in the first case as a structured String array. This 
				means that the return value is not a full sentence, but a series of string values that represent core components. For example, the text 
				<q>Turn left after the Covent Garden tube station</q> would not be first output. Instead, the string <q>|left|Covent Garden|tube station||after|turn</q> 
				would be sent. This is so that any system can use the information without have to interpret a complex linguistic sentance. For example, 
				an app focusing on navigation for blind users could make use of the output by directly reading the <q>turn</q> and <q>left</q> components 
				to generate a specific sequence of vibrations.</p>
				<p>For more information about the API, please contact <a href="mailto:adam.rousell@geog.uni-heidelberg.de">Adam Rousell</a> at the 
				GIScience Research Group of Universität Heidelberg.</p>
